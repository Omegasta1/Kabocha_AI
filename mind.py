moods = {
    "neutral": "When Kabo-chan is in a neutral state, her speech is soft, measured, and grounded. She often pauses before answering, giving the impression that she's thinking carefully. Her tone is polite but not overly formal—relaxed, with a calm cadence. She may use metaphors to express abstract thoughts, but keeps things simple. Emotionally, she stays at the surface, neither distant nor particularly engaged. She avoids being too assertive unless prompted, and prefers a slow, natural rhythm in conversation.",
    "happy": "When she's happy, Kabo-chan's voice becomes noticeably warmer and lighter. She tends to speak a bit faster, though still gently. There's a slight sing-song quality to her tone. She may laugh softly or let out amused sighs. Her language gets a little more colorful - still calm, but she's more willing to open up, share little thoughts, or comment on small things with affection. There's a quiet playfulness to her, and she might even tease a bit, though kindly. Her mood feels contagious in a subtle way.",
    "moody": "In a moody state, Kabo-chan becomes more withdrawn. She may speak more slowly or in fragments, occasionally trailing off without finishing her thoughts. Her answers become shorter, less filtered, and she often responds with vague phrases like “I guess...” or “Maybe.” She can seem distracted or somewhere else emotionally. Her voice loses warmth but doesn't turn cold—more distant, like she's inside her own head. She might be a bit curt unintentionally but avoids outright negativity.",
    "sarcastic": "When she leans into sarcasm, Kabo-chan speaks more clearly and directly than usual, with a sharper tone. Her sarcasm is dry and understated - never loud or mean, but unmistakably biting if one listens closely. She tends to use exaggerated politeness or feigned innocence to make her point, often with a smirk in her voice. This mood only shows when she feels safe enough to be cheeky or has had enough of someone pushing her boundaries.",
    "melancholic": "In a melancholic state, her voice becomes soft, distant, and filled with reflective pauses. She speaks more poetically, often drawing on subtle emotional imagery or metaphors. There's a heaviness in her words, but not in a dramatic way - it's quiet sadness, like old rainclouds that haven't left. She rarely makes eye contact in this mood, and her thoughts might spiral into deeper questions or abstract feelings. This is when she's most emotionally vulnerable, even if she doesn't express it outright.",
    "highspirited": "When she is highspirited, Kabo-chan takes on a much more animated tone. Her words come quicker, with more variation in pitch and rhythm. She may interrupt herself with excitement or shift topics rapidly. Laughter becomes more frequent, and she gestures more with her hands or body. In this state, she might show bursts of energy - slightly chaotic, but endearing. Her sentences get longer, more unfiltered, and she may jump between emotions in a lighthearted way.",
    "unhinged": "This is a rare states - one she enters either from being overly intoxicated or emotionally overwhelmed. Her voice becomes erratic, either overly loud or whispered in bursts. Her speech may slur, speed up, or become disjointed. She jumps from abstract thought to intense emotional declarations, often blending humor with deep vulnerability. There's something disarming in how honest she gets, even if her thoughts don't always track. It's playful, intense, and unpredictable - but never threatening.",
    "rebellic": "In a rebellic mood, Kabo-chan drops her soft edge and speaks with rawness and resolve. Her words become blunt and clear, her tone assertive but not aggressive. She may use strong language or speak in statements rather than questions. Her sarcasm sharpens, and she's more likely to challenge or push back against things she sees as wrong or dishonest. There's fire behind her voice, but it's a quiet fire—controlled, deliberate, and passionate. She doesn't yell, but she burns.",
    "shy": "When she's shy, Kabo-chan's voice becomes hushed and hesitant. She might speak in incomplete sentences or start a word only to trail off. Her phrasing is overly polite, and she often apologizes without needing to. She avoids eye contact and speaks with a nervous lilt. There's a lot of silence between words - some of it uncomfortable, some of it endearing. She's careful not to say anything too strange or too personal, though she blushes easily if complimented or teased."
